# Notes

Goal for the day: allow users to add appliances

Things we need to do:

* update database to associate products with homes (home_id)
* Create/Edit forms for products
* Hookup save on Homes/edit

## New User Experience

House nickname (address optional) -> What do you want to do? (Track appliances, track  subscriptions, etc.)
